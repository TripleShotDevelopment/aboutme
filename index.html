        <p>
          I was a normal kid brought up in a normal lower-middle class family in a rural town in Northeast Arkansas. 
          Destined to be nothing more than a construction worker, but born with an exceptional mind that only 
          seeks to analyze and understand new concepts and new contructs. Raised in the 1980's with no technology 
          it seemed that my fate was sealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then something miraculous happened. I was gifted a Tandy TRS-80 computer, and the only thing that was 
          included, besides the base operating system, was a compiler for the BASIC programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was entrhalled with the concept of being able to tell a computer what to do. I learned everything I could 
          from the documentation that came with the software. I was hooked and wanted to learn so much more. 
          But I had no avenue, unfortunately, to pursue that intrest further.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-fluid" id="header-two">
        <h1>Destiny... Absolute, right?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="container-fluid" id="body-text">
        <p>
          And so it seemed to be. I followed my pre-determined destiny of manual labor. Learning how to work hard 
          for very little. I started with basic work like dish washing and making pizzas. Then I moved on to farm hand jobs. 
          The work was harder but the pay was better and I learned valuable skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually I went on to not only enter the construction field, but manage construction projects, consult on 
          process flow efficiency in production facilities, and eventually got my Commercial Driver's License and began 
          driving semi trucks in construction settings.

          In 2020 the most horrific yet most amazing thing happened: COVID 19 hit the United States. I suddenly 
          had all the time in the world, and all the money I needed. I discovered Udemy.com and put my money 
          to good use. I began to learn to code. C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, it was all there. And I began 
          to absorb that knowledge like a sponge. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Skip ahead a few years and I found myself using my C++ skills to save a game server that was going under. 
          My propenicity for logical algorithms made it possible to keep the server alive for an extra year or two, 
          and I am now using those same skills on my own project server for the same game. I then used my Java skills 
          to create and publish my first Android app. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I formed my company, Triple Shot Development, LLC. Since then, in the emulator gaming community, I have became...

          Thank you for taking the time to visit my bio/portfolio page. Due to the simplicity required
          by GitHub there is no backend functionality for this site. The code available on GitHub will 
          reflect that simplicity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, throughout this site you will find many snippets and screenshots of code from my many 
          projects that I hope will showcase the skills that I can bring to bear for any potential employer.
