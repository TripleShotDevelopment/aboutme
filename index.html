          I was a normal kid brought up in a normal lower-middle class family in a rural town in Northeast Arkansas. 
          Destined to be nothing more than a construction worker, but born with an exceptional mind that only 
          seeks to analyze and understand new concepts and new contructs. Raised in the 1980's with no technology 
          it seemed that my fate was sealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then something miraculous happened. I was gifted a Tandy TRS-80 computer, and the only thing that was 
          included, besides the base operating system, was a compiler for the BASIC programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was entrhalled with the concept of being able to tell a computer what to do. I learned everything I could 
          from the documentation that came with the software. I was hooked and wanted to learn so much more. 
          But I had no avenue, unfortunately, to pursue that intrest further.

          And so it seemed to be. I followed my pre-determined destiny of manual labor. Learning how to work hard 
          for very little. I started with basic work like dish washing and making pizzas. Then I got farm hand jobs. 
          The work was harder but the pay was better and I learned valuable skills. Eventually I went on to not only 
          enter the construction field, but manage construction projects, consult on process flow efficiency in production 
          facilities, and eventually got my Commercial Driver's License and began driving semi trucks in construction 
          settings.

          In 2020 the most horrific yet most amazing thing happened: COVID 19 hit the United States. I suddenly 
          had all the time in the world, and all the money I needed. I discovered Udemy.com and put my money 
          to good use. I began to learn to code. C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, it was all there. And I began 
          to absorb that knowledge like a sponge. Skip ahead a few years and I find myself using my C++ skills 
          to save a game server that was going under. My propenicity for logical algorithms made it possible to 
          keep it alive for an extra year or two, and I am now using those same skills on my own project server 
          for the same game. I used my Java skills to create and publish my first Android app. And then I formed 
          Triple Shot Development, LLC. Since then, in the emulator gaming community, I have became...

          Thank you for taking the time to visit my little portfolio page. Due to the simplicity required
          by GitHub there is no backend functionality for this site. 
          The code available on GitHub will reflect that simplicity. 
          However, throughout this site you will find many snippets and screenshots
          of code from my many projects that I hope will showcase the skills that I 
          can bring to bear for any potential employer.
